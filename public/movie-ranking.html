<h3> Guy Ritchie's THE COVENANT</h3>
<p>
    This movie is about a Sargent and an ex taliban turned interpriter who gets seperated from the rest of their unit who were ambushed by the taliban in Afganistan <br />
    They become fugetives and are held at a high bounty to collect as they run through the Afgani mountains on foot for about a week or so. <br>
    Somewhere along the trail , the taliban catches them off guard and the Sargant is shot in the shoulder, hip, and foot, forcing the Interpriter to drag him along the way for many days. <br>
    eventually their squad catches up with them and the sargant goes unconcious and is shipped back to america and the interpriter goes into hiding. <br>
    filled with guilt, the sargant flee's back to Afghanistan and battles through troubles with the taliban to bring his friend who helped save his life. <br>

<h3> NOPE </h3>
<p>
    The movie NOPE takes place on a farm house somewhere on the outskirts of a large town in the united states. <br>
    A man and his sister encounter an unidentified object which stalks them and the city terroizing and literally sucking and eating the citizen which live within. <br>
    Long story short . It symbolized an Angel ... Lol

<h3> They cloned Tyrone </h3>
<p>
    Now this movie I can say was my favorite and least favorite watch of this year . I say favorite because it relates to what is going on in today's society <br>
    as far as what is portrayed on the media and how consumers soak it up and normalize outlandish behavior. <br>
    The movie takes a turn and it becomes a whole mind control thing with an oppresive white guy who can control young black kids with the snap of his finger .. <br>
    although that part was annoying it turned out to be a really decent movie . I def would refer someone to watch when they have nonthing else they're looking forward to.
